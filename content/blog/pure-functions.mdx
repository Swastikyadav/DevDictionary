## What it is:

A pure function is like a mathematical formula. Given the same input, it always produces the same output and doesn't change anything outside itself.

## Why it matters:

Pure functions are predictable, testable, and don't cause unexpected side effects in your program.

## Real-world analogy:

A calculator is pure. When you input 2 + 3, you always get 5, and the calculator doesn't change anything else in the world.

## Example

```js
// PURE FUNCTION - Always returns same output for same input
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(2, 3)); // Always returns 5
console.log(add(2, 3)); // Always returns 5

// IMPURE FUNCTION - Has side effects
let counter = 0;
function impureAdd(a, b) {
  counter++; // Changes something outside the function
  console.log("Adding numbers"); // Prints to console (side effect)
  return a + b;
}

// PURE vs IMPURE comparison
// Pure: Same input, same output, no side effects
function multiply(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}

// Impure: Depends on external state
let tax = 0.1;
function calculateTotal(price) {
  return price + price * tax; // Depends on external 'tax' variable
}
```

If you're familiar with ReactJs functional components, you must understand how important pure functions are.
