## What it is:

Inheritance is like a family tree for code. Just as you inherit traits from your parents, classes (blueprints for objects) can inherit properties and behaviors from other classes.

## Why it matters:

It prevents code duplication and creates logical relationships between related things.

## Real-world analogy:

Think of vehicles. All vehicles have wheels and can move, but a car is different from a motorcycle. Instead of writing separate code for every vehicle type, you create a base "Vehicle" class and let specific vehicles inherit from it.

## Example

```js
// Parent class (base class)
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  eat() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is eating`);
  }

  sleep() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is sleeping`);
  }
}

// Child class inherits from Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name); // Call parent constructor
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  bark() {
    console.log(`${this.name} says woof!`);
  }
}

// Usage
const myDog = new Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever");
myDog.eat(); // Inherited from Animal
myDog.bark(); // Dog's own method
```

The Dog class gets all of Animal's abilities (eat, sleep) plus its own special ability (bark).
