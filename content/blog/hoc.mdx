## What it is:

An HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new, enhanced component. It's like a wrapper that adds extra functionality.

## Why it matters:

HOCs let you reuse component logic across multiple components without repeating code.

## Real-world analogy:

Think of gift wrapping. You can wrap any gift (component) with wrapping paper (HOC) to make it look fancy, but the gift inside remains the same.

## Key points about HOC:

- Input: Takes a component as an argument.
- Output: Returns a new component with added functionality.
- Reusability: The same HOC can enhance multiple different components.
- Non-desctructive: The original component remains unchanged.

## Example:

```js
// HOC that adds a border to any component
function withBorder(Component) {
  return function BorderedComponent(props) {
    return (
      <div style={{ border: "2px solid red" }}>
        <Component {...props} />
      </div>
    );
  };
}

// Usage
const ButtonWithBorder = withBorder(Button);
const TextWithBorder = withBorder(Text);
```
